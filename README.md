# Radio tests for the pycubed-mini boards

## Lora Testing
Need two instances of [lora_radio_range_test](https://github.com/PyCubed-Mini/Tests/tree/main/lora_radio_range_test), for example one running on a pycubed-mini and one running on a raspberry pi.
Running the script on the board should give configuration options, most can be kept as default except for the board type (pycubed-mini, feather, raspberry pi) and transmission/reception.
Make sure to set one board to receive and one to transmit.
